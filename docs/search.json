To collect, organize, analyze and visualize of large amounts of data to make informed business decisions\n\n\n\nPrompt 2\n\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nSimilarities\n\nBoth work with large amounts of data.\nBoth roles require a strong foundation in mathematics and probability theory and use statistical methods to analyze data\nThey often use programming languages (such as R or Python) for data manipulation and analysis.\n\nDifferences\n\nData Scientist often deal with messy, unstructured data and spend a significant amount of time cleaning and preprocessing data. On the other hand, Statisticians typically work with cleaner, well-organized data and may not need as much data cleaning\nData Scientist work on predictive modelling whereas statisticians work on inference and experimental design\n\n\n\n\nPrompt 3\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas? I currently lean more toward the role of a statistician, but I aspire to be versatile enough to handle both data science and statistical tasks when needed. ## Running Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris Data\n\ny Object Assignment\nAssigning the given code to object y:\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\nDetermining the class of y using class() .\n\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\n\nDetermining the object type of y using typeof() .\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nDetermining the structure of y using str() .\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 7\n $ x        : num [1:512] 3.48 3.49 3.5 3.51 3.52 ...\n $ y        : num [1:512] 0.000232 0.000262 0.000296 0.000333 0.000373 ...\n $ bw       : num 0.274\n $ n        : int 150\n $ call     : language density.default(x = iris$Sepal.Length)\n $ data.name: chr \"iris$Sepal.Length\"\n $ has.na   : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\n\n\nPlot of y\nPlotting the object y with function plot() .
